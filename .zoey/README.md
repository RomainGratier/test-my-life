# .zoey directory

This folder guides Zoey (the AI agent) and you through the challenge.

- `knowledge.yaml`: Problem definition, requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
- `codefolio.json`: A user-facing summary for portfolio presentation.

Zoey will read these to plan and propose changes. Update them as your understanding evolves.
