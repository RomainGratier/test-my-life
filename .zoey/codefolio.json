      "content": "The implementation follows a full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns. The backend uses Express.js with CORS enabled for cross-origin requests, implements RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes, and includes comprehensive error handling. The frontend uses vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features, implements responsive design with CSS Grid, and provides real-time user feedback through dynamic message displays."
