        "text": "**Current Implementation Status: Challenge Completed!**\n\nThe Enterprise Authentication Challenge has been successfully completed, with all previously identified implementation tasks now fully integrated and verified. The system demonstrates robust functionality and adherence to enterprise standards.\n\n**Key Completed Implementations:**\n\n*   **Architectural Refinement:** The authentication module has been fully refactored to a service-oriented architecture, enhancing modularity and maintainability with dedicated `AuthService`, `UserService`, and `ValidationService` modules.\n*   **Environment-Based Configuration:** Sensitive credentials, timeouts, and security parameters are centralized in environment variables for robust management and security (e.g., JWT expiry, rate limiting settings).\n*   **Middleware Integration:** Reusable Express.js middleware for cross-cutting concerns like token-based authentication and rate limiting is fully implemented, ensuring separation of concerns and reusability.\n*   **Enterprise Password Policies:** Implemented and enforced client-side and server-side, meeting strict requirements (12+ chars, complexity including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and common password prevention).\n*   **Advanced CSS Styling:** All specified styling requirements are met, including gradient buttons with hover effects, custom focus rings, responsive card layouts centered on desktop and fluid on mobile, and various animations.\n*   **Comprehensive Input Validation:** Real-time client-side and robust server-side validation is fully integrated, leveraging the `ValidationService` for all authentication inputs.\n*   **Security Enhancements:** Full integration of rate limiting (5 attempts per 5-minute window per IP) and other security measures like SQL injection prevention and proper HTTP status codes, leveraging the `RateLimitService`.\n*   **CSS Grid Layout:** The main application structure now uses a well-implemented CSS Grid layout, ensuring a responsive and robust base.\n*   **Custom Animations & UX:** Dashboard welcome animation, success/error message animations, and other UX enhancements have been implemented for a polished user experience.\n*   **Production-Ready Error Handling:** Consistent and proper error handling with clear JSON responses and appropriate HTTP status codes is fully implemented.\n\n**Verification Highlights (from Pipeline Tests):**\n\n*   Complete authentication system, responsive design, and accessibility features are fully functional.\n*   JWT token authentication, password validation, and rate limiting are working correctly.\n*   UI enhancements including gradient buttons, custom focus rings, and animations are as specified.\n*   Performance metrics (60fps, <100ms validation, <2s page load) are achieved.\n*   Comprehensive test coverage (visual feedback, form validation, accessibility, responsive design, UX, performance, edge cases) shows all tests PASSED.",

        "text": "**🔐 Security Requirements:**\n\n**Password Policies:**\n- Minimum 12 characters\n- Must contain uppercase letters\n- Must contain lowercase letters\n- Must contain numbers\n- Must contain special characters (!@#$%^&*())\n- Prevent common passwords (password, 123456, etc.)\n- Enforce on both client and server side\n\n**Token Management:**\n- Short-lived access tokens (15-30 minutes recommended)\n- Proper token storage (localStorage or memory)\n- Refresh token strategy awareness (HTTP-only cookies for long-lived tokens)\n- JWT secret from environment variables (never hardcoded)\n\n**Security Features:**\n- Rate limiting: Max 5 login attempts per 5-minute window per IP\n- SQL injection prevention: Use parameterized queries\n- Comprehensive input validation with regex patterns\n- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500)\n\n**🎨 CSS & Styling Requirements:**\n\n**Form Card Layout:**\n- Desktop: Centered vertically and horizontally, max-width 400px\n- Mobile: 95% viewport width, fluid height with auto padding\n\n**Button Styling:**\n- Linear gradient background\n- Subtle box-shadow on hover\n- transform: translateY(-2px) on hover\n\n**Input Fields:**\n- Custom focus ring color (distinct from browser default)\n- 1px solid border that changes color on focus\n\n**Layout & Animations:**\n- CSS Grid for main layout (header, content, footer)\n- Dashboard welcome animation: Fade in and slide up from bottom\n- Responsive design for all screen sizes\n\n**🏛️ Architecture Requirements:**\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Client-side form validation before server requests\n- Server-side validation as ultimate source of truth\n- CSS Grid for main application layout\n- Modular component structure\n\n**Backend:**\n- Unique username index for performance and integrity\n- TEXT(72) password hash column for bcrypt compatibility\n- Consistent JSON error responses\n- Proper HTTP status codes\n- Environment variable configuration",
