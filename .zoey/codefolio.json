      "content": "The implementation follows a full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns. The backend uses Express.js with CORS enabled for cross-origin requests, implements RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes, and includes comprehensive error handling. The frontend uses vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features, implements responsive design with CSS Grid, and provides real-time user feedback through dynamic message displays."

      "content": {
        "text": "This codefolio demonstrates mastery of modern full-stack web development through a sophisticated authentication system that exemplifies production-grade security practices. The Node.js Express backend showcases advanced security implementation with JWT token management (24h expiration), bcrypt password hashing (12 salt rounds), comprehensive input validation with regex patterns, and middleware-based route protection. The system features enterprise-level error handling, RESTful API design, CORS configuration, and in-memory user management with proper data structures. The responsive frontend integrates seamlessly with the backend, implementing token-based authentication, localStorage management, automatic session validation, and dynamic UI updates. This implementation represents a complete, scalable foundation for secure web applications, highlighting expertise in web security, API architecture, and modern JavaScript development practices."
