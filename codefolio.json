  "resume": "This authentication challenge evaluates comprehensive full-stack development skills through enterprise-grade security implementation. Candidates must demonstrate mastery of modern web security practices including advanced password policies, JWT token management, bcrypt password hashing, and comprehensive input validation. The challenge tests CSS expertise through specific styling requirements: responsive card layouts, gradient button implementations, custom focus rings, and CSS Grid architecture. Frontend development skills are evaluated through form validation, authentication state management, and responsive design patterns. Backend security implementation focuses on proper error handling, API design, SQL injection prevention, and production-ready practices. This challenge represents a complete assessment of modern web development capabilities, emphasizing both technical implementation and user experience design.",
