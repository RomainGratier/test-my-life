    token_management:
      # Access tokens should be short-lived (e.g., 15-30 minutes) and stored in memory or localStorage.
      # They are sent with every API request via the Authorization: Bearer header.
      # A more robust system would use long-lived refresh tokens stored in HTTP-only, secure cookies
      # to obtain new access tokens when they expire. For this challenge, focus on secure access token

  frontend:
